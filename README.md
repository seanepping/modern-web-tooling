# modern-web-tooling

This is the code I use to demo during talks on Node based frontend workflow tools.

## Navigating

There are git tags you can follow if you want to see the sequence of work.  The first one is 'start'  and the tooling follows with grunt, gulp, webpack, and jspm.

## Thank You

Thanks to [TodoMvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) for having a great project and giving me something to build upon.

## Feedback

Please feel free to contact me or submit meaningful pull requests.

## Note

The angularjs code has not been touched, but it may be in the future.
